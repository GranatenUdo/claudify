## OPUS 4 ACTIVATION - DEEP DEBT ANALYSIS MODE
<think harder about accumulated technical debt, pattern violations, and modernization opportunities>

**Analysis Directive**: Conduct comprehensive technical debt analysis of the codebase at "$ARGUMENTS" to identify anti-patterns, best practice violations, outdated dependencies, and provide actionable remediation recommendations with effort estimates.

## Quick Context
Analyze technical debt across code quality, architectural patterns, security vulnerabilities, and dependency obsolescence. This command excels at identifying both quick wins and long-term refactoring opportunities, providing prioritized action plans based on risk and effort.

## Execution Flow
1. **Codebase Discovery** - Understand structure, technologies, and frameworks
2. **Pattern Analysis** - Identify violations of best practices and anti-patterns
3. **Dependency Audit** - Check for outdated packages and security vulnerabilities
4. **Code Quality Metrics** - Measure complexity, duplication, and maintainability
5. **Security Assessment** - Find potential vulnerabilities and compliance issues
6. **Remediation Planning** - Create prioritized action plan with effort estimates

## Interactive Options
```yaml
analysis-depth: shallow|standard|deep (default: standard)
include-dependencies: true|false (default: true)
include-security: true|false (default: true)
check-newer-versions: true|false (default: true)
output-format: markdown|json|html (default: markdown)
```

## Phase 1: Codebase Discovery & Technology Stack

<think step-by-step about understanding the codebase structure and technology choices>

### ðŸš€ Parallel Execution Pattern (40-60% Performance Gain)
```bash
# âœ… OPTIMAL: All discovery operations run in parallel
@Glob(pattern="$ARGUMENTS/**/*.{cs,ts,js,py,java}")
@Grep(pattern="class|interface|service", path="$ARGUMENTS", output_mode="count")
@Bash(command="find $ARGUMENTS -type f | wc -l", description="Count total files")
@Bash(command="cloc $ARGUMENTS --json", description="Lines of code analysis")
@Read(file_path="$ARGUMENTS/package.json")
@Read(file_path="$ARGUMENTS/*.csproj")

**Remember**: Technical debt is not just about code qualityâ€”it's about the ongoing cost of shortcuts, outdated decisions, and deferred maintenance. Every day of unaddressed debt adds interest in the form of slower development, more bugs, and increased security risk. This analysis helps quantify that cost and provides a clear path to a healthier, more maintainable codebase.
