# Claudify Features - Version 4.0.0

## Overview

Claudify configures Claude Code for .NET/Angular projects by detecting project structure and applying templates to commands and agents.

## Security

### Agent Tool Access Control
- Each agent has restricted tool access based on its role
- Tool permissions are defined in agent configuration files
- No agent has access to all tools

#### Tool Access by Role
| Role | Allowed Tools | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Code Reviewer | Read, Edit, MultiEdit, Grep, Glob, LS | Code analysis and improvement suggestions |
| Security Reviewer | Read, Grep, Glob, LS, WebSearch, Bash | Security scanning and vulnerability research |
| Tech Lead | Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, LS, TodoWrite | Architecture decisions and documentation |
| Researcher | Read, WebSearch, WebFetch, Write, TodoWrite | External research and documentation |
| Frontend Developer | Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Grep, Glob, LS | UI/UX development |
| Test Analyst | Read, Write, Grep, Glob, LS, Bash | Test creation and execution |

## Agents

### Available Agents
17 specialized agents for different development tasks:
- Code review and quality analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Technical architecture decisions
- Frontend and backend implementation
- Test creation and analysis
- Documentation writing

### Agent Configuration
- Agents defined as markdown files with metadata
- Tool access restrictions per agent
- Stored in `.claude/agents/` directory
