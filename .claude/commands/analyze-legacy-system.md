# üèõÔ∏è Legacy System Analysis: $ARGUMENTS



**Analysis Directive**: Conduct comprehensive analysis of the legacy system at "$ARGUMENTS" to extract business logic, map dependencies, document interfaces, and create a modernization blueprint. Focus on understanding the "why" behind the code, not just the "what".

## Quick Context
Analyze legacy .NET systems (Framework 4.7.2 and similar) to extract business logic, system architecture, dependencies, and interfaces for modernization initiatives. This command excels at understanding complex, undocumented systems and producing actionable modernization plans.

## Execution Flow
1. **System Discovery** - Understand project structure and technology stack
2. **Dependency Mapping** - Map all internal and external dependencies
3. **Business Logic Extraction** - Identify and document core business rules
4. **Interface Analysis** - Extract all integration points and contracts
5. **Modernization Planning** - Create migration strategy and recommendations

## Interactive Options
```yaml
analysis-depth: shallow|standard|deep (default: deep)
include-database: true|false (default: true)
include-external-services: true|false (default: true)
generate-migration-code: true|false (default: false)
output-format: markdown|json|html (default: markdown)
```

## Phase 1: System Discovery & Initial Assessment



### Multi-Agent System Analysis

#### Legacy Framework Assessment
Using the Legacy System Analyzer agent to: Analyze the legacy .NET system at '$ARGUMENTS':
1. Identify .NET Framework version and runtime dependencies
2. Map project structure and solution organization
3. Identify key architectural patterns (n-tier, MVC, WebForms, etc.)
4. List all project types (Web, Library, Service, etc.)
5. Identify configuration management approach
6. Map deployment artifacts and hosting requirements
7. Assess overall system complexity and size
Provide comprehensive system overview with technology inventory

#### Initial Security Scan
I'll have the general-purpose agent Legacy security assessment.

### System Inventory Checklist

## Phase 2: Dependency Analysis



### Dependency Mapping Tasks

#### Internal Dependencies
```
Analyzing internal project references and dependencies:

```yaml
# Example Interface Documentation
Service: CustomerService
  Endpoint: /api/customers
  Methods:
    - GetCustomer(id: int): CustomerDto
    - CreateCustomer(customer: CustomerDto): int
    - UpdateCustomer(id: int, customer: CustomerDto): bool
  
  DataContracts:
    CustomerDto:
      - Id: int
      - Name: string (required, max 100)
      - Email: string (email format)
      - Status: enum (Active, Inactive, Suspended)
```

### Integration Point Matrix
| Integration Type | Count | Protocol | Documentation | Modernization Strategy |
|-----------------|-------|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| REST APIs | - | HTTP/JSON | - | - |
| SOAP Services | - | XML/SOAP | - | - |
| Database Direct | - | SQL | - | - |
