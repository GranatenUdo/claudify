# ðŸ”§ Refactor Code: $ARGUMENTS

## Quick Context
Use this command to improve existing code quality through systematic refactoring, focusing on simplification, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.

## Execution Flow
1. **Analysis** - Understand current code structure and identify issues
2. **Simplification** - Apply refactoring patterns to reduce complexity
3. **Validation** - Ensure functionality is preserved with proper testing

## Interactive Options
```yaml
dry-run: Analyze and suggest changes without applying them
preserve-tests: Ensure all existing tests still pass
extract-methods: Aggressively extract complex logic into smaller methods
```

## Phase 1: Code Analysis



### Initial Assessment
I'll analyze the target code to understand its current state and identify refactoring opportunities.

```bash
# Examine code structure
Searching for pattern: class|interface|method|function

# Check complexity indicators
Searching for pattern: if.*else|switch|while|for
```

### Multi-Agent Analysis

#### Code Simplifier Assessment
I'll invoke the Code Simplifier agent to identify simplification opportunities.

I'll have the Technical Debt Analyst agent Identify refactoring opportunities.

#### Code Quality Review
Next, I'll get a comprehensive code quality assessment.

I'll have the general-purpose agent Code quality analysis.

#### Technical Debt Assessment
I'll identify technical debt that should be addressed during refactoring.

I'll have the Technical Debt Analyst agent Technical debt analysis.

#### Test Quality Analysis
I'll ensure test coverage supports safe refactoring.

I'll have the general-purpose agent Test coverage analysis.

## Phase 2: Refactoring Strategy



### Refactoring Priorities
Based on the analysis, I'll create a prioritized refactoring plan:

1. **Critical Issues** - Breaking functionality or severe maintainability problems
2. **High Impact** - Significant complexity reduction opportunities
3. **Quick Wins** - Simple improvements with immediate benefits
4. **Nice to Have** - Minor enhancements for code aesthetics

### Common Refactoring Patterns

#### 1. Extract Method
```csharp
// Before: Complex method with multiple responsibilities
public async Task<Result<Field>> ProcessFieldData(FieldDto dto)
{
    // 50+ lines of validation, transformation, and business logic
}

// After: Clear separation of concerns
public async Task<Result<Field>> ProcessFieldData(FieldDto dto)
{
    var validationResult = ValidateFieldData(dto);
    if (!validationResult.IsSuccess) return validationResult;
    
    var field = TransformToEntity(dto);
    var businessResult = ApplyBusinessRules(field);
    if (!businessResult.IsSuccess) return businessResult;
    
    return await SaveField(field);
}
```

#### 2. Replace Conditional with Polymorphism
```csharp
// Before: Complex switch statement
public decimal CalculateYield(string cropType, decimal area)
{
    switch (cropType)
    {
        case "Grapes": // Complex grape calculation
        case "Wheat": // Complex wheat calculation
        // More cases...
    }
}

// After: Strategy pattern
public decimal CalculateYield(ICropYieldStrategy strategy, decimal area)
{
    return strategy.Calculate(area);
}
```

## Phase 3: Implementation

<think about preserving functionality while improving code structure>

### Systematic Refactoring Process

1. **Create Safety Net**
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage exists
   - Add characterization tests if needed
   - Set up continuous test running

2. **Apply Refactorings**
   - Make one change at a time
   - Run tests after each change
   - Commit frequently for easy rollback

3. **Validate Results**
   - Confirm all tests pass
   - Check performance metrics
   - Review with team if needed

### Interactive Confirmation
```markdown
## Refactoring Plan Summary

The following refactorings will be applied to $ARGUMENTS:

1. **Extract Method**: [Count] complex methods will be broken down
2. **Rename**: [Count] unclear names will be improved
3. **Consolidate**: [Count] duplicate code blocks will be merged
4. **Simplify**: [Count] over-complex structures will be simplified

Estimated changes: [Total] modifications across [FileCount] files

Proceed with refactoring? (yes/no/dry-run)
```

## Phase 4: Validation & Documentation

<think about ensuring code quality improvements are measurable>

### Tech Lead Architecture Review
I'll have the Tech Lead validate that refactorings maintain architectural integrity.

I'll have the general-purpose agent Validate refactoring architecture.

### Documentation Updates
After refactoring, I'll update:
- Method/class documentation
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- README files if APIs changed
- Test documentation

## Success Criteria
- âœ… All existing tests pass without modification
- âœ… Code complexity metrics improve by at least 20%
- âœ… No performance regressions detected
- âœ… Code coverage maintained or improved
- âœ… Team review approval obtained

## Error Handling

### Rollback Strategy
If issues arise during refactoring:
1. Git stash current changes
2. Run tests on original code
3. Identify the problematic refactoring
4. Apply a different approach or defer

### Common Issues
- **Test Failures**: Usually indicates behavior change - revert and re-analyze
- **Performance Degradation**: Profile before and after, optimize hot paths
- **Integration Breaks**: Check contracts haven't changed unintentionally

## Example Usage

```bash
# Refactor a specific service
/refactor-code src/services/FieldService.cs

# Refactor all services with dry-run
/refactor-code src/services/**/*Service.cs --dry-run

# Aggressive refactoring with method extraction
/refactor-code src/domain/Field.cs --extract-methods
```

## Final Report

Upon completion, you'll receive:
- Before/after complexity metrics
- List of all refactorings applied
- Test coverage report
- Performance comparison
- Suggestions for further improvements
