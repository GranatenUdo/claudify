# üöÄ Parallel Comprehensive Review: $ARGUMENTS

## Parallel Multi-Agent Analysis (60 seconds with parallel execution)

### üî¥ Security Review Agent
@Task(
  description="Security vulnerability scan",
  prompt="Review '$ARGUMENTS' for CRITICAL security issues:
  
  TOP 3 SECURITY CHECKS:
  1. Missing OrganizationId filters (multi-tenant breach risk)
  2. userId accepted in URLs (should be from JWT only)
  3. Hardcoded secrets/credentials
  
  Use Grep to find:
  - ToListAsync without OrganizationId
  - userId in controller routes
  - password= or apiKey= patterns
  
  Return ONLY critical exploitable issues with file:line references.
  Provide exact fix code for each issue found.
  
  Skip theoretical risks - focus on actual vulnerabilities.",
  subagent_type="security-reviewer"
)

### ‚ö° Performance Review Agent
@Task(
  description="Performance bottleneck scan",
  prompt="Review '$ARGUMENTS' for PERFORMANCE KILLERS:
  
  TOP 3 PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
  1. N+1 queries (foreach with await inside)
  2. Missing AsNoTracking() on read operations
  3. Multiple enumerations of same collection
  
  Use Grep to find:
  - 'foreach.*await' patterns
  - Multiple .Include() chains
  - ToList() called multiple times
  
  Return ONLY issues that impact user experience.
  Show before/after code for each fix.
  
  Ignore micro-optimizations.",
  subagent_type="technical-debt-analyst"
)

### üìä Code Quality Agent  
@Task(
  description="Code complexity scan",
  prompt="Review '$ARGUMENTS' for MAINTAINABILITY ISSUES:
  
  TOP 3 QUALITY PROBLEMS:
  1. Deeply nested if statements (>3 levels)
  2. Swallowed exceptions (catch Exception with no handling)
  3. Code duplication patterns
  
  Use Grep to find:
  - Nested if/else chains
  - 'catch.*Exception' with empty blocks
  - TODO/HACK/FIXME comments
  
  Return ONLY issues that slow down development.
  Provide refactored code for complex sections.
  
  Skip style preferences.",
  subagent_type="code-reviewer"
)

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Review Agent
@Task(
  description="Architecture pattern violations",
  prompt="Review '$ARGUMENTS' for ARCHITECTURE VIOLATIONS:
  
  TOP 3 PATTERN VIOLATIONS:
  1. Controllers accessing repositories directly
  2. Services throwing exceptions instead of Result<T>
  3. Missing factory methods for entity creation
  
  Use Grep to analyze:
  - Layer violations
  - Pattern inconsistencies
  - Abstraction leaks
  
  Return ONLY violations that break system design.
  Show correct pattern implementation.
  
  Ignore minor deviations.",
  subagent_type="tech-lead"
)

### üß™ Test Quality Agent
@Task(
  description="Test coverage and quality scan",
  prompt="Review tests for '$ARGUMENTS' checking:
  
  TOP 3 TEST ISSUES:
  1. Missing critical path tests
  2. Tests that don't assert anything
  3. Flaky tests with timing dependencies
  
  Use Grep to find:
  - Test files for the component
  - Assert statements
  - Task.Delay or Thread.Sleep in tests
  
  Return ONLY missing critical test scenarios.
  Provide test code for uncovered paths.
  
  Skip test style issues.",
  subagent_type="test-quality-analyst"
)

## üìã Consolidated Report Format

After parallel analysis completes, consolidate findings:

```markdown
# Review Summary for $ARGUMENTS

## üî¥ CRITICAL (Must Fix Now)
1. [Security Issue with proof and fix]
2. [Performance killer with solution]
3. [Architecture violation with correction]

## üü° IMPORTANT (Fix This Sprint)  
1. [Quality issue affecting maintenance]
2. [Missing critical test]
3. [Technical debt item]

## üü¢ MINOR (Track for Later)
1. [Style improvements]
2. [Documentation needs]
3. [Optimization opportunities]

## Metrics
- Security Score: X/10
- Performance Score: X/10
- Quality Score: X/10
- Overall Health: X/10
```

## Parallel Execution Benefits
- **5x faster**: All agents run simultaneously
- **Comprehensive**: No blind spots with specialized agents
- **Consistent**: Each agent focuses on their expertise
- **Actionable**: Concrete fixes, not just problems

## What We SKIP
- Perfect code style
- 100% test coverage
- Theoretical improvements
- Academic best practices
- Minor optimizations
