# üîç Comprehensive Review: $ARGUMENTS

## üöÄ Optimization Features
- **Parallel execution**: Yes - All agents analyze simultaneously (40-60% faster)
- **Extended thinking**: Yes - Complex synthesis requires deep analysis
- **Confidence scoring**: Yes - Each finding includes confidence levels
- **Subagent coordination**: Yes - Proper subagent_type for each Task invocation

## Quick Context
Use this command for critical features, major PRs, or architectural decisions that require multi-perspective analysis from all specialized agents.

## Execution Flow
1. **Discovery** - Understand the scope and context
2. **Multi-Agent Analysis** - Each agent provides specialized perspective
3. **Synthesis** - Combine insights into actionable recommendations
4. **Priority Matrix** - Organize findings by impact and urgency

## Interactive Options
```yaml
focus: security|performance|ux|architecture|all (default: all)
depth: quick|standard|deep (default: standard)
output: summary|detailed|matrix (default: summary)
```

## Phase 0: Task Management Setup

### üìã TodoWrite Task Management


I'll update the task list to track our progress.

## Phase 1: Context Discovery



### Scope Analysis
I'll first understand what we're reviewing and its broader context.

### üöÄ Parallel Execution Pattern (40-60% Performance Gain)
```bash
# ‚úÖ OPTIMAL: All operations run in parallel (takes ~2 minutes)
Searching for pattern: class|interface|controller|service|component
Running command: `git log --oneline -20 -- $ARGUMENTS`
Searching for pattern: import|using|require
Finding files matching: **/*.ts
Finding files matching: **/*.cs
Reading file: package.json
Reading file: README.md

# ‚ùå AVOID: Sequential execution (would take 10+ minutes)
# Execute grep, wait for result
# Then execute bash, wait for result
# Then execute another grep, wait for result
```

### Initial Assessment Questions
- What is the primary purpose of this code/feature?
- Who are the end users and stakeholders?
- What are the critical success factors?
- What could go wrong and what's the impact?

## Phase 2: Parallel Multi-Agent Analysis

## Phase 5: Modern Frontend Patterns (if applicable)



### üé® Modern Frontend Pattern Analysis

If $ARGUMENTS includes frontend components, apply these modern patterns:

#### Signal-Based Architecture (Angular 19)
```typescript
// ‚ùå OLD: Observable patterns
export class OldComponent {
    items$ = new BehaviorSubject<Item[]>([]);
    loading$ = new BehaviorSubject<boolean>(false);
}

// ‚úÖ NEW: Pure signals
export class ModernComponent {
    items = signal<Item[]>([]);
    loading = signal(false);
    filteredItems = computed(() => 
        this.items().filter(item => item.active)
    );
}
```

#### Modern CSS Architecture
```css
/* CSS Layers for better cascade control */
@layer reset, base, components, utilities;

/* Container queries for responsive components */
.feature-card {
    container: card / inline-size;
}

@container card (width > 300px) {
    /* Responsive styles */
}
```

#### Accessibility Patterns
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimization
- Focus management
- ARIA attributes
