# üîç Comprehensive Review: $ARGUMENTS

## Quick Context
Use this command for critical features, major PRs, or architectural decisions that require multi-perspective analysis from all specialized agents.

## Execution Flow
1. **Discovery** - Understand the scope and context
2. **Multi-Agent Analysis** - Each agent provides specialized perspective
3. **Synthesis** - Combine insights into actionable recommendations
4. **Priority Matrix** - Organize findings by impact and urgency

## Interactive Options
```yaml
focus: security|performance|ux|architecture|all (default: all)
depth: quick|standard|deep (default: standard)
output: summary|detailed|matrix (default: summary)
```

## Phase 0: Task Management Setup

### üìã TodoWrite Task Management
<think step-by-step about organizing the comprehensive review tasks>

@TodoWrite(todos=[
  {id: "1", content: "Context discovery and scope analysis", status: "in_progress", priority: "high"},
  {id: "2", content: "Parallel multi-agent analysis", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "3", content: "Synthesize findings", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "4", content: "Create priority matrix", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "5", content: "Generate action plan", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "6", content: "Calculate confidence score", status: "pending", priority: "high"}
])

## Phase 1: Context Discovery

<think harder about understanding the full scope and impact of what we're reviewing>

### Scope Analysis
I'll first understand what we're reviewing and its broader context.

### üöÄ Parallel Execution Pattern (40-60% Performance Gain)
```bash
# ‚úÖ OPTIMAL: All operations run in parallel (takes ~2 minutes)
@Grep(pattern="class|interface|controller|service|component", path="$ARGUMENTS", output_mode="files_with_matches")
@Bash(command="git log --oneline -20 -- $ARGUMENTS", description="Recent commits in scope")
@Grep(pattern="import|using|require", path="$ARGUMENTS", output_mode="content", head_limit=50)
@Glob(pattern="**/*.ts")
@Glob(pattern="**/*.cs")
@Read(file_path="package.json")
@Read(file_path="README.md")

# ‚ùå AVOID: Sequential execution (would take 10+ minutes)
# Execute grep, wait for result
# Then execute bash, wait for result
# Then execute another grep, wait for result
```

### Initial Assessment Questions
- What is the primary purpose of this code/feature?
- Who are the end users and stakeholders?
- What are the critical success factors?
- What could go wrong and what's the impact?

## Phase 2: Parallel Multi-Agent Analysis

<think harder about optimal parallelization strategy for comprehensive review>
<think step-by-step about agent selection based on the feature type>

### üìä Agent Specialization Matrix

| Feature Type | Primary Agents | Secondary Agents | Parallel? |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| Backend API | Tech Lead, Security Reviewer | Code Reviewer, Test Quality | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Frontend UI | Frontend Developer, UX Reviewer | Visual Designer, Code Reviewer | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Full Stack | All Agents | - | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Security Fix | Security Reviewer, Tech Lead | Code Reviewer | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Performance | Tech Lead, Code Simplifier | Code Reviewer | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Database | Tech Lead, Security Reviewer | Code Reviewer | ‚úÖ Yes |

<think harder about modern UI/UX patterns if frontend is involved>

### üé® Modern Frontend Pattern Analysis

If $ARGUMENTS includes frontend components, apply these modern patterns:

#### Signal-Based Architecture (Angular 19)
```typescript
// ‚ùå OLD: Observable patterns
export class OldComponent {
    items$ = new BehaviorSubject<Item[]>([]);
    loading$ = new BehaviorSubject<boolean>(false);
}

// ‚úÖ NEW: Pure signals
export class ModernComponent {
    items = signal<Item[]>([]);
    loading = signal(false);
    filteredItems = computed(() => 
        this.items().filter(item => item.active)
    );
}
```

#### Modern CSS Architecture
```css
/* CSS Layers for better cascade control */
@layer reset, base, components, utilities;

/* Container queries for responsive components */
.feature-card {
    container: card / inline-size;
}

@container card (width > 300px) {
    /* Responsive styles */
}
```

#### Accessibility Patterns
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimization
- Focus management
- ARIA attributes
