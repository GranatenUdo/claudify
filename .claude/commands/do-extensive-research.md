# üß† Deep Research Analysis: $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 0: Task Management Setup

### üìã TodoWrite Task Management
<think step-by-step about organizing the research process>

@TodoWrite(todos=[
  {id: "1", content: "Define research scope and questions", status: "in_progress", priority: "high"},
  {id: "2", content: "Parallel information gathering", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "3", content: "Multi-agent analysis", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "4", content: "Pattern recognition", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "5", content: "Synthesize findings", status: "pending", priority: "high"},
  {id: "6", content: "Generate recommendations", status: "pending", priority: "high"}
])

### üìä Agent Specialization Matrix

| Research Type | Primary Agent | Secondary Agents | Parallel? |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| Technical | Tech Lead | Code Reviewer | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Security | Security Reviewer | Tech Lead | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Best Practices | Researcher | Tech Lead | ‚úÖ Yes |
| Industry | Researcher | - | ‚ùå No |

## OPUS 4 ACTIVATION - EXTENDED THINKING MODE
<think harder about the research topic from multiple perspectives - technical, business, operational, and strategic implications>

**Research Directive**: Conduct comprehensive analysis of "$ARGUMENTS" using deep interleaved thinking to uncover insights, patterns, and actionable recommendations. Leverage Opus 4's advanced reasoning capabilities to explore complex interconnections and provide strategic guidance.

## Phase 1: Research Scope Definition (Deep Reasoning)

<think step-by-step about the research dimensions and boundaries>

### Initial Analysis Framework
Execute parallel research streams:
1. **Domain Context**: Understanding the problem space
2. **Current State Analysis**: What exists today - patterns, solutions, limitations
3. **Industry Best Practices**: How leading organizations solve similar challenges
4. **Future Trends**: Emerging technologies and methodologies
5. **Risk & Opportunity Assessment**: What to leverage vs. what to avoid

### Research Questions to Address
<think deeper about the fundamental questions that need answering>
