## Phase 5: Risk Analysis & Mitigation (Deep Thinking)

<think harder about what could go wrong and how to prevent it>

### Risk Matrix

| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Technical Debt | Medium | High | Incremental refactoring, clear boundaries |
| Performance Degradation | Low | High | Load testing, monitoring, gradual rollout |
| Team Resistance | Medium | Medium | Early involvement, training, clear benefits |
| Integration Failures | Low | Medium | Comprehensive testing, fallback mechanisms |
| Budget Overrun | Medium | Medium | Phased approach, regular checkpoints |

### Contingency Planning
1. **Fallback Options**: Alternative approaches if primary fails
2. **Rollback Procedures**: How to safely revert changes
3. **Communication Plan**: Stakeholder updates and escalation
