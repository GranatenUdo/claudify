## 🧪 Testing Commands

### Test Creation
- **`add-backend-tests`** - Unit and integration tests for C#/.NET
- **`add-frontend-tests`** - Component and service tests for Angular

### Validation
- **`validate-release`** - Release readiness validation
- **`health-check`** - System health assessment

## 🎨 Specialized Commands

### UI/UX
- **`figma-implement-current-selection`** - Convert Figma designs to code

### Marketing & Sales
- **`generate-marketing-material`** - Create marketing content

### Meta Commands
- **`create-command-and-or-agent`** - Create new commands or agents
- **`optimize-command`** - Improve existing commands

## ⚡ Parallel Execution Commands

Commands marked with ⚡ use parallel agent execution for 85-90% time savings:
- Multiple specialized agents work simultaneously
- Automatic result consolidation
- Comprehensive coverage with no blind spots

## 📖 Documentation

- [PARALLEL-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md](../PARALLEL-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md) - How parallel execution works
- [RESEARCH-BEST-PRACTICES.md](../RESEARCH-BEST-PRACTICES.md) - Research command guidelines
- [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) - Project conventions and patterns

## 🎯 Command Selection Guide

### For Research
- **Simple question?** → `quick-research`
- **Need synthesis?** → `smart-research`
- **Security concern?** → `research-security`
- **Performance issue?** → `research-performance`
- **Architecture decision?** → `research-architecture`

### For Development
- **New feature?** → `implement-full-stack-feature`
- **Code review?** → `comprehensive-review`
- **Security check?** → `security-audit`
- **Performance fix?** → `performance-optimization`

### Time-Sensitive?
Choose ⚡ parallel commands for fastest results:
- `comprehensive-review` - 1 minute vs 5 minutes
- `implement-full-stack-feature` - 3 minutes vs 20 minutes
- `security-audit` - 1 minute vs 10 minutes

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Use specialized research** for important decisions
2. **Leverage parallel execution** for complex tasks
3. **Choose the right depth** - not every question needs deep research
4. **Focus on actionable output** - research should lead to decisions

## 🚫 Deprecated Commands

The following patterns have been removed as anti-patterns:
- Overly complex "extensive research" templates
- Commands that generate documentation without purpose
- Generic commands that don't leverage specialized agents
