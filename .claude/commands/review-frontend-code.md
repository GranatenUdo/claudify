# ðŸŽ¯ Review Frontend Code: $ARGUMENTS

<think about the TOP 3 issues that could cause real problems in this frontend code>

## Phase 1: Smart Discovery (1 min)

### Find Target Files
@Glob(pattern="**/*$ARGUMENTS*")
@Grep(pattern="class|@Component|@Injectable|signal", path="$ARGUMENTS", output_mode="files_with_matches", head_limit=10)

### Read Critical Files
<!-- Read 2-3 most important files only -->

## Phase 2: Value-Focused Review (5 min)

### Frontend Developer Analysis
@Task(description="Frontend code review", prompt="Review frontend code in '$ARGUMENTS' for HIGH-IMPACT issues:

FOCUS ON TOP 3 ISSUES:
1. BREAKS functionality (bugs, infinite loops, memory leaks)
2. VIOLATES patterns (signals misuse, wrong Angular patterns, bad state management)
3. HURTS users (performance problems, accessibility issues, mobile breaks)

CHECK SPECIFICALLY:
âœ“ Signal usage (update vs set, computed efficiency)
âœ“ Change detection (OnPush everywhere?)
âœ“ Memory leaks (subscriptions cleaned up?)
âœ“ Result<T> pattern (proper error handling?)
âœ“ Angular 19 syntax (*ngIf not @if)
âœ“ Organization scoping (enforced?)
âœ“ Type safety (no 'any' types)

FOR EACH ISSUE:
- Problem: [Specific description]
- Impact: [What happens if not fixed]
- Fix: [Exact code to implement]
- Priority: [Critical/High/Medium]

Skip style preferences. Focus on what actually matters.", subagent_type="Frontend Developer")

### Security Quick Check
@Task(description="Security review", prompt="Security check for '$ARGUMENTS' frontend code:

CHECK ONLY:
1. XSS vulnerabilities (innerHTML, sanitization)
2. Sensitive data exposure (logs, localStorage)
3. API key/token handling
4. Organization isolation

If SECURE: Say 'Security âœ“'
If ISSUES: Provide exact fix

Skip theoretical risks.", subagent_type="Security Reviewer")

## Phase 3: Actionable Output (2 min)

### Review Summary

#### ðŸ”´ Critical Issues (Fix Now)
<!-- Issues that break functionality -->

#### ðŸŸ¡ Important Issues (Fix This Sprint)
<!-- Issues that hurt maintainability -->

#### ðŸŸ¢ Nice to Have (Backlog)
<!-- Minor improvements -->

### Code Quality Metrics
- Signal Architecture: [âœ“/âœ—]
- Change Detection: [âœ“/âœ—]
- Error Handling: [âœ“/âœ—]
- Type Safety: [âœ“/âœ—]
- Security: [âœ“/âœ—]

### Top 3 Actions
1. [Most important fix]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]

## Value Principles
1. **Impact Focus**: Find what could actually break
2. **Pattern Compliance**: Ensure consistency
3. **User Experience**: Consider real user impact
4. **Quick Validation**: 5-8 minutes to insights
5. **Actionable Output**: Specific fixes, not vague concerns

Remember: Find the few issues that matter, not every possible improvement.
