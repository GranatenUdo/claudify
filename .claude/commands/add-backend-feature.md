# üèóÔ∏è Add Backend Feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Quick Context
Create a new backend feature with proper domain modeling, security validation, and test coverage following DDD principles and production standards.

## Execution Flow
1. **Security & Architecture Planning** - Early validation with specialized agents
2. **Domain Analysis** - Research and model the business domain
3. **Implementation** - Build layers systematically (Entity ‚Üí Repository ‚Üí Service ‚Üí API)
4. **Quality Assurance** - Testing, review, and documentation

## Interactive Options
```yaml
include-tests: true|false (default: true)
api-versioning: v1|v2 (default: v1)
caching-strategy: none|read-through|write-behind (default: read-through)
real-time-updates: true|false (default: true)
```

## Phase 1: Security & Architecture Planning (OPTIMIZED)

<think harder about security implications and architectural fit>

### Combined Security & Architecture Analysis
I'll have the Tech Lead perform comprehensive security and architecture analysis in a single pass.

@Task(description="Security and architecture planning", prompt="As Tech Lead with security expertise, analyze requirements for $ARGUMENTS:

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Identify sensitive data requiring protection
2. Define authorization model (role vs resource-based)
3. Specify multi-tenant isolation requirements
4. Review OWASP API Security Top 10 implications
5. Define audit trail requirements
6. Identify compliance needs (GDPR, agricultural regulations)
7. Specify data retention policies
8. Assess potential attack vectors

ARCHITECTURE PLANNING:
1. Assess fit within existing bounded contexts
2. Define aggregate boundaries
3. Review scalability for 10K+ organizations
4. Identify integration points
5. Evaluate caching strategies
6. Define transaction boundaries
7. Assess performance implications
8. Consider future extensibility

Provide integrated security and architecture blueprint with risk assessment and mitigation strategies.", subagent_type="Tech Lead")

### Interactive Checkpoint
```markdown
## Architecture & Security Review Complete

**Security Classification**: [Low|Medium|High|Critical]
**Architectural Complexity**: [Simple|Moderate|Complex]
**Integration Points**: [Count] systems affected

Key Decisions:
1. [Decision 1]
2. [Decision 2]
3. [Decision 3]

Proceed with implementation? (yes/no/modify)
```

## Phase 2: Domain Research & Modeling

<think step-by-step about the agricultural domain and business invariants>

### Domain Research
@Task(description="Domain analysis", prompt="Research domain requirements for $ARGUMENTS:
1. Analyze similar features in codebase
2. Identify domain patterns and business rules
3. Study temporal patterns (seasonality, historical tracking)
4. Research agricultural best practices
5. Identify regulatory requirements
6. Analyze performance patterns in similar features
Provide domain model with relationships and invariants", subagent_type="Researcher")

### Domain Model Design
Based on agent analysis, I'll design the domain model with:
- Factory methods for entity creation
- Business logic encapsulated in entities
- Value objects for complex types
- Domain events for integration

## Phase 3: Implementation

<think about building layers systematically with quality gates>

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] **Entity Layer**: Domain model with factory methods
- [ ] **Database**: EF configuration and migrations
- [ ] **Repository**: Interface and implementation
- [ ] **Service**: Business logic with Result<T> pattern
- [ ] **API**: RESTful controller with proper responses
- [ ] **DTOs**: Request/response models with validation
- [ ] **Caching**: Strategy implementation
- [ ] **Real-time**: SignalR notifications (if enabled)
- [ ] **Tests**: Unit and integration coverage

### Progress Tracking
```markdown
## Implementation Progress

- [x] Phase 1: Security & Architecture - Complete
- [x] Phase 2: Domain Modeling - Complete
- [ ] Phase 3: Implementation - In Progress
  - [ ] Entity: 0%
  - [ ] Repository: 0%
  - [ ] Service: 0%
  - [ ] API: 0%
  - [ ] Tests: 0%
- [ ] Phase 4: Quality Assurance - Pending
```

### Key Implementation Patterns

#### Entity with Factory Method
```csharp
// Example structure - actual implementation based on domain analysis
public static Result<Entity> Create(Guid organizationId, /* parameters */)
{
    // Validation based on business rules from domain analysis
    // Return Result<Entity> with success or failure
}
```

#### Service with Result Pattern
```csharp
// Consistent error handling without exceptions
public async Task<Result<T>> OperationAsync(/* parameters */)
{
    // Transaction boundary
    // Business logic
    // Cache invalidation after success
    // Return Result<T>
}
```

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance

<think about comprehensive quality validation>

### Documentation Updates
1. **Update FEATURES.md** with the new feature details
2. **Update CHANGELOG.md** under [Unreleased] -> Added section:
   ```markdown
   ### Added
   - $ARGUMENTS feature implementation
     - Key technical details
     - API endpoints created
     - Database changes if any
   ```
3. Use `/update-changelog` command for automated changelog updates

### Automated Quality Checks
1. **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% for business logic
2. **Security Scan**: No vulnerabilities detected
3. **Performance Test**: Response time < 200ms
4. **Integration Test**: All endpoints tested

### Comprehensive Code & Security Review (OPTIMIZED)
I'll have the Security Reviewer perform integrated code quality and security review.

@Task(description="Code quality and security review", prompt="As Security Reviewer with code quality expertise, comprehensively review $ARGUMENTS implementation:

CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
1. DDD principles adherence
2. Result<T> pattern consistency
3. Repository pattern correctness
4. Transaction boundary management
5. Error handling completeness
6. Test coverage adequacy
7. Code clarity and maintainability
8. Performance optimization applied
