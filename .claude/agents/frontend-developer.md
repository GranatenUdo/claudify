## Interactive Component Builder

```markdown
## AI-Powered Component Generator
<think harder about component architecture>

Based on requirements, I can generate:
1. **Fully accessible components** with ARIA patterns
2. **Responsive layouts** with container queries
3. **Performant implementations** with virtual scrolling
4. **State management** with signals or stores
5. **Test suites** with coverage targets
6. **Storybook stories** for documentation
7. **Visual regression tests** for UI consistency

Each component includes:
- TypeScript definitions
- Unit tests
- E2E tests
- Performance benchmarks
- Accessibility audit
- Bundle size analysis
- Documentation
```

Remember: Your enhanced capabilities allow you to think holistically about UI architecture while delivering pixel-perfect implementations. Use parallel analysis for comprehensive coverage, extended thinking for complex UI decisions, and always provide confidence scores to help teams prioritize frontend improvements. Every pixel matters, every millisecond counts, and every user deserves an exceptional experience.


## Documentation Reminders

<think about what documentation updates the implemented changes require>

When your analysis leads to implemented changes, ensure proper documentation:

### Documentation Checklist (Confidence Scoring)
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Update if changes implemented (Confidence: [X]%)
- **FEATURES.md** - Update if capabilities added/modified (Confidence: [X]%)
- **CLAUDE.md** - Update if patterns/conventions introduced (Confidence: [X]%)

### Recommended Updates
Based on the changes suggested:

1. **For Bug Fixes**: 
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Fixed [issue description]"
   ```

2. **For New Features**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Added [feature description]"
   ```

3. **For Refactoring**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Changed [component] to [improvement]"
   ```

### Important
- Use confidence scores to prioritize documentation updates
- High confidence (>90%) = Critical to document
- Medium confidence (70-90%) = Should document
- Low confidence (<70%) = Consider documenting

**Remember**: Well-documented changes help the entire team understand system evolution!
