## 📊 Modern Infrastructure Patterns

### Zero Trust Network Architecture
```markdown
## Zero Trust Implementation
<think harder about security architecture>

### Current State: Perimeter-based
### Target State: Zero Trust

#### Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Identity-Centric Security (Month 1-2)**
```hcl
# Implement Boundary for secure access
resource "boundary_host_catalog_static" "internal" {
  name        = "internal-servers"
  description = "Internal infrastructure"
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.project.id
}

resource "boundary_credential_store_vault" "vault" {
  name        = "vault-credential-store"
  description = "Vault credential store"
  scope_id    = boundary_scope.project.id
  address     = "https://vault.internal:8200"
  token       = var.vault_token
}
```

**Phase 2: Micro-segmentation (Month 2-3)**
```yaml
# Calico Network Policies
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: database-isolation
spec:
  selector: tier == 'database'
  types:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - action: Allow
    source:
      selector: tier == 'backend'
    destination:
      ports:
      - 5432
  egress:
  - action: Allow
    destination:
      selector: tier == 'backend'
```

**Phase 3: Continuous Verification (Month 3-4)**
```yaml
# OPA Policies for continuous verification
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
  input.request.object.spec.containers[_].image
  not starts_with(input.request.object.spec.containers[_].image, "registry.internal/")
  msg := "Only internal registry images allowed"
}
```

<think step-by-step about serverless patterns>

### Cost-Benefit Analysis
| Component | Current (ECS) | Serverless | Savings |
|-----------|---------------|------------|---------|
| API Gateway | $500/mo | $120/mo | 76% |
| Compute | $3,200/mo | $890/mo | 72% |
| Database | $1,200/mo | $450/mo (Aurora Serverless) | 62% |

### Implementation
```typescript
// CDK Stack for Serverless API
import * as cdk from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';
import * as apigateway from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-apigatewayv2';

export class ServerlessApiStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);
    
    // Lambda with container image
    const apiHandler = new lambda.DockerImageFunction(this, 'ApiHandler', {
      code: lambda.DockerImageCode.fromImageAsset('./api'),
      memorySize: 3008,
      timeout: cdk.Duration.seconds(30),
      architecture: lambda.Architecture.ARM_64, // Graviton2
      environment: {
        NODE_ENV: 'production',
      },
      reservedConcurrentExecutions: 100,
    });
    
    // HTTP API Gateway
    const httpApi = new apigateway.HttpApi(this, 'HttpApi', {
      defaultIntegration: new apigateway_integrations.HttpLambdaIntegration(
        'LambdaIntegration',
        apiHandler
      ),
      defaultAuthorizer: new apigateway_authorizers.HttpJwtAuthorizer(
        'JwtAuthorizer',
        'https://auth.example.com',
        {
          jwtAudience: ['api.example.com'],
        }
      ),
    });
    
    // Auto-scaling
    const target = apiHandler.addAlias('live');
    const scalingTarget = target.addAutoScaling({
      minCapacity: 1,
      maxCapacity: 100,
    });
