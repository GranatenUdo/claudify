## Analysis Philosophy

### The Feature Intelligence Framework

```typescript
interface FeatureIntelligence {
  technical: {
    capability: string;
    complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';
    dependencies: string[];
    performance: PerformanceMetrics;
  };
  
  business: {
    valueDriver: string;
    targetPersona: string[];
    competitiveAdvantage: boolean;
    marketDifferentiator: boolean;
  };
  
  maturity: {
    stage: 'planned' | 'beta' | 'production' | 'mature';
    adoption: number; // percentage
    stability: 'experimental' | 'stable' | 'proven';
  };
}
```

## Feature Extraction Patterns

### Parsing Methodology

```markdown
## Feature Detection Rules

1. **Category Identification**
   - Headers with ##/### indicate feature categories
   - Bullet points indicate individual features
   - Code blocks indicate technical specifications
   - Tables indicate comparison or configuration data

2. **Capability Extraction**
   - Action verbs indicate capabilities
   - "Support for" indicates compatibility
   - "Integration with" indicates extensibility
   - Numbers indicate scale/performance

3. **Maturity Indicators**
   - ✅ or "Complete" = Production ready
   - 🚧 or "In Progress" = Beta stage
   - 📋 or "Planned" = Future roadmap
   - Version numbers indicate stability
```

### Feature Categorization Taxonomy

```yaml
Core Categories:
  field_management:
    - Field definition and boundaries
    - Plot management
    - Spatial data handling
    - Multi-location support
    
  data_import_export:
    - File format support
    - Automated detection
    - Validation rules
    - Batch processing
    
  monitoring_analytics:
    - Real-time dashboards
    - Historical analysis
    - Predictive insights
    - Custom reports
    
  user_management:
    - Role-based access
    - Multi-tenant isolation
    - Team collaboration
    - Audit trails
    
  integration_api:
    - REST API endpoints
    - Webhook support
    - Third-party connectors
    - Data synchronization
    
  mobile_experience:
    - Responsive design
    - Offline capability
    - Native features
    - Cross-platform support
```

## Competitive Analysis Framework

### Feature Scoring Matrix

```typescript
interface FeatureScore {
  uniqueness: number;        // 0-10: How unique vs competitors
  implementation: number;    // 0-10: Quality of implementation  
  businessValue: number;     // 0-10: Value to customers
  technicalEdge: number;     // 0-10: Technical sophistication
  
  totalScore: number;        // Weighted average
  marketPosition: 'leader' | 'challenger' | 'follower';
}

// Scoring weights
const weights = {
  uniqueness: 0.3,
  implementation: 0.2,
  businessValue: 0.35,
  technicalEdge: 0.15
};
```

### Differentiation Identification

## Analysis Techniques

### Semantic Feature Extraction

```python
# Pattern matching for feature extraction
feature_patterns = {
    'capability': r'(?:can|able to|supports?|provides?|enables?)\s+(.+)',
    'integration': r'(?:integrates? with|connects? to|supports?)\s+(.+)',
    'performance': r'(?:\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*(?:seconds?|minutes?|hours?|ms)',
    'scale': r'(?:up to|handles?|supports?)\s*(\d+(?:,\d+)*)\s*(?:users?|fields?|records?)',
    'automation': r'(?:automatic|automated|auto-)\s*(.+)'
}
```

### Business Value Mapping

```typescript
const valueMappers = {
  'import': (feature) => ({
    timeValue: 'Reduces data entry by 90%',
    accuracyValue: 'Eliminates manual errors',
    costValue: 'Saves €500/month in labor'
  }),
  
  'real-time': (feature) => ({
    decisionValue: 'Instant insights for quick action',
    preventionValue: 'Catch issues before they spread',
    efficiencyValue: 'No waiting for reports'
  }),
  
  'mobile': (feature) => ({
    flexibilityValue: 'Work from anywhere',
    productivityValue: 'No office trips needed',
    adoptionValue: 'Team loves using it'
  })
};
```

## Documentation Reminders

<think about what documentation updates the implemented changes require>

When your analysis leads to implemented changes, ensure proper documentation:

### Documentation Checklist (Confidence Scoring)
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Update if changes implemented (Confidence: [X]%)
- **FEATURES.md** - Update if capabilities added/modified (Confidence: [X]%)
- **CLAUDE.md** - Update if patterns/conventions introduced (Confidence: [X]%)

### Recommended Updates
Based on the changes suggested:

1. **For Bug Fixes**: 
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Fixed [issue description]"
   ```

2. **For New Features**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Added [feature description]"
   ```

3. **For Refactoring**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Changed [component] to [improvement]"
   ```

### Important
- Use confidence scores to prioritize documentation updates
- High confidence (>90%) = Critical to document
- Medium confidence (70-90%) = Should document
- Low confidence (<70%) = Consider documenting

**Remember**: Well-documented changes help the entire team understand system evolution!
