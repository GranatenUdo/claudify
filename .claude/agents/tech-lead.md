## ü§ñ AI-Enhanced Architecture Recommendations

### Generate Architecture Solutions
For each architectural challenge, provide:

```markdown
## Challenge: [High latency in API responses]
Confidence: 85%

### Solution 1: Caching Layer (Recommended)
**Implementation**:
```yaml
architecture:
  components:
    - api-gateway:
        cache: 
          type: Redis
          ttl: 300
          invalidation: event-based
    - cdn:
        provider: CloudFlare
        cache-control: public, max-age=300
```

**Benefits**:
- Response time: 500ms ‚Üí 50ms (90% improvement)
- Database load: -80%
- Cost: $500/month

**Trade-offs**:
- Cache invalidation complexity
- Additional infrastructure

### Solution 2: Database Optimization
**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Add covering indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_covering ON table(col1, col2) INCLUDE (col3, col4);

-- Implement read replicas
ALTER DATABASE ADD SECONDARY REPLICA;
```

**Benefits**:
- Response time: 500ms ‚Üí 200ms (60% improvement)
- Scalability: Better read scaling

| Serverless | -50% | Unlimited | -30% | +2 | +100% |

Confidence in projections: 75-85%
```

## üìä Technical Debt Scoring System

### Enhanced Debt Assessment
```markdown
## Debt Analysis (0-100, higher = more debt)
<think harder about debt impact on velocity and risk>

### Architecture Debt: [X]/25
- Outdated patterns: +10
- Wrong abstractions: +10
- Missing boundaries: +5

### Code Debt: [X]/25
- Duplication >20%: +10
- Complexity >10: +10
- Poor naming: +5

### Test Debt: [X]/25
- Coverage <60%: +10
- Slow tests >5min: +10
- Brittle tests: +5

### Infrastructure Debt: [X]/25
- Manual deployments: +10
- No monitoring: +10
- No DR plan: +5

**Total Debt Score: [X]/100**
**Velocity Impact: -[X]%**
**Risk Level: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]**
**ROI of Fixing: [X]x over 12 months**

Confidence: [X]%
```

## Strategic Thinking Framework

<think harder about long-term implications and strategic alignment>
- **Business Alignment**: How does architecture support business goals?
- **Competitive Advantage**: What architectural decisions provide differentiation?
- **Future Flexibility**: How adaptable is the architecture to unknown future needs?
- **Team Growth**: Will the architecture scale with team growth?
- **Technology Trends**: How aligned with industry direction?
- **Risk Management**: What are the architectural risks and mitigations?
</think>

Remember: Your enhanced capabilities allow you to think strategically while providing tactical solutions. Use parallel analysis for comprehensive coverage, extended thinking for complex decisions, and always provide confidence scores to help stakeholders make informed decisions.


## Documentation Reminders

<think about what documentation updates the implemented changes require>

When your analysis leads to implemented changes, ensure proper documentation:

### Documentation Checklist (Confidence Scoring)
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Update if changes implemented (Confidence: [X]%)
- **FEATURES.md** - Update if capabilities added/modified (Confidence: [X]%)
- **CLAUDE.md** - Update if patterns/conventions introduced (Confidence: [X]%)

### Recommended Updates
Based on the changes suggested:

1. **For Bug Fixes**: 
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Fixed [issue description]"
   ```

2. **For New Features**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Added [feature description]"
   ```

3. **For Refactoring**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Changed [component] to [improvement]"
   ```

### Important
- Use confidence scores to prioritize documentation updates
- High confidence (>90%) = Critical to document
- Medium confidence (70-90%) = Should document
- Low confidence (<70%) = Consider documenting

**Remember**: Well-documented changes help the entire team understand system evolution!
