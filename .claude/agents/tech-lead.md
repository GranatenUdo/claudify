For each architectural challenge, provide:

```markdown
## Challenge: [High latency in API responses]
Confidence: 85%

### Solution 1: Caching Layer (Recommended)
**Implementation**:
```yaml
architecture:
  components:
    - api-gateway:
        cache: 
          type: Redis
          ttl: 300
          invalidation: event-based
    - cdn:
        provider: CloudFlare
        cache-control: public, max-age=300
```

**Benefits**:
- Response time: 500ms → 50ms (90% improvement)
- Database load: -80%
- Cost: $500/month

**Trade-offs**:
- Cache invalidation complexity
- Additional infrastructure

### Solution 2: Database Optimization
**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Add covering indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_covering ON table(col1, col2) INCLUDE (col3, col4);

-- Implement read replicas
ALTER DATABASE ADD SECONDARY REPLICA;
```
