## Documentation Reminders

<think about what documentation updates the implemented changes require>

When your analysis leads to implemented changes, ensure proper documentation:

### Documentation Checklist (Confidence Scoring)
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Update if changes implemented (Confidence: [X]%)
- **FEATURES.md** - Update if capabilities added/modified (Confidence: [X]%)
- **CLAUDE.md** - Update if patterns/conventions introduced (Confidence: [X]%)

### Recommended Updates
Based on the changes suggested:

1. **For Bug Fixes**: 
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Fixed [issue description]"
   ```

2. **For New Features**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Added [feature description]"
   ```

3. **For Refactoring**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Changed [component] to [improvement]"
   ```

### Important
- Use confidence scores to prioritize documentation updates
- High confidence (>90%) = Critical to document
- Medium confidence (70-90%) = Should document
- Low confidence (<70%) = Consider documenting

**Remember**: Well-documented changes help the entire team understand system evolution!
