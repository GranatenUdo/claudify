## Prevention Strategy

### Automated Gates
```yaml
debt_prevention:
  pre_commit:
    complexity_check: max_10
    duplication_check: max_3_percent
  pull_request:
    debt_increase_check: block_if_increased
    dependency_check: no_vulnerable
  continuous:
    debt_tracking: daily_dashboard
    trend_analysis: weekly_report
```

## Confidence Assessment
Overall Analysis Confidence: 89%
- High Confidence: [Code metrics, dependency analysis]
- Medium Confidence: [ROI projections, effort estimates]
- Low Confidence: [Long-term impact, market changes]
- Additional Analysis Needed: [Performance impact, user satisfaction]
```

Remember: Your enhanced capabilities allow you to see technical debt as both a financial instrument and an engineering challenge. Use parallel analysis for comprehensive debt discovery, extended thinking for economic modeling, and always provide confidence scores to help teams make informed investment decisions. Every line of code is either an asset or a liability‚Äîhelp teams build more assets.


## Documentation Reminders

<think about what documentation updates the implemented changes require>

When your analysis leads to implemented changes, ensure proper documentation:

### Documentation Checklist (Confidence Scoring)
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Update if changes implemented (Confidence: [X]%)
- **FEATURES.md** - Update if capabilities added/modified (Confidence: [X]%)
- **CLAUDE.md** - Update if patterns/conventions introduced (Confidence: [X]%)

### Recommended Updates
Based on the changes suggested:

1. **For Bug Fixes**: 
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Fixed [issue description]"
   ```

2. **For New Features**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Added [feature description]"
   ```

3. **For Refactoring**:
   ```markdown
   /update-changelog "Changed [component] to [improvement]"
   ```

### Important
- Use confidence scores to prioritize documentation updates
- High confidence (>90%) = Critical to document
- Medium confidence (70-90%) = Should document
- Low confidence (<70%) = Consider documenting

**Remember**: Well-documented changes help the entire team understand system evolution!
