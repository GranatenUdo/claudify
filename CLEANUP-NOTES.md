# Cleanup Notes for Claudify v4.0.0

## Manual Deletion Required

The `.claudify-sdk/` directory should be **manually deleted** from the repository.

### Why Delete It?

1. **Violates Claude Code Best Practices**: The TypeScript analyzer pre-caches conventions, which contradicts the "intentionally low-level and unopinionated" philosophy
2. **No Longer Used**: Commands now examine code dynamically at runtime (no caching)
3. **1600+ LOC Removed**: Significant codebase reduction
4. **Complexity Removed**: No mode selection, no cache management, no refresh logic

### To Delete:

```bash
rm -rf .claudify-sdk/
```

### What It Contained:
- TypeScript analyzer (1,612 LOC)
- Node modules (package.json, package-lock.json)
- Build artifacts (dist/)
- Test files

### Impact of Deletion:
- ✅ No functional impact (analyzer not used in v4.0.0)
- ✅ Cleaner repository
- ✅ Simpler architecture
- ✅ Better alignment with Claude Code philosophy

## Other Obsolete Files to Note

If you have projects that used v3.x, they may have these obsolete config files:

```
.claude/config/projects.json          # Old project configuration
.claude/config/project-knowledge.json # Old convention cache
.claude/config/claudify.json          # Old mode tracking
```

These are safe to delete - v4.0.0 doesn't use any of them.

## v4.0.0 Clean State

After cleanup, Claudify installation creates only:

```
your-project/
├── .claude/
│   ├── commands/    # 40+ command files
│   └── agents/      # 30+ agent files
```

**No configuration. No caching. Pure commands.**

**Claudify 4.0.0** - Aligned with official Claude Code best practices.
