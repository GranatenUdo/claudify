/review-backend-code
# Wait for completion...
/analyze-security
# Wait for completion...
/analyze-technical-debt
# Total time: 45+ minutes

# Claudify approach (fast, parallel)
/comprehensive-review
# All agents run simultaneously - Total time: 15 minutes
```

- Test strategies for safe migration

## 💡 Power User Tips

### Tip 1: Leverage Confidence Scores
Agents provide confidence scores (0-100%) for their recommendations. Use these to prioritize:

```typescript
// High confidence (>90%): Implement immediately
Security finding: SQL injection vulnerability (Confidence: 98%)
→ Action: Fix today

// Medium confidence (70-90%): Review and validate
Architecture recommendation: Microservices split (Confidence: 78%)
→ Action: Prototype first

// Lower confidence (<70%): Gather more data
Performance optimization: Caching strategy (Confidence: 65%)
→ Action: Benchmark before implementing
```

### Tip 2: Use Parallel Commands for Speed
Leverage commands that automatically run agents in parallel:

```markdown
# Sequential approach (avoid this):
/review-backend-code      # 20 minutes
/analyze-security         # 15 minutes  
/analyze-test-quality     # 10 minutes
# Total: 45 minutes

# Parallel approach (use this):
/comprehensive-review
# Total: 15 minutes (all agents run simultaneously)
```

### Tip 3: Chain Command Outputs
Use command outputs to inform next steps:

```markdown
# Step 1: Identify debt
/analyze-technical-debt

# Step 2: Based on the debt analysis, refactor
/refactor-code [component identified in debt analysis]

# Step 3: Generate tests for refactored code
/generate-tests
```

## 📊 Understanding the Output

### Confidence Scores Explained
```markdown
Confidence: 95% - Very High
→ Based on clear patterns, extensive data
→ Safe to implement without additional validation

Confidence: 85% - High
→ Strong indicators, some assumptions
→ Recommend quick review before implementation

Confidence: 75% - Moderate
→ Good hypothesis, needs validation
→ Prototype or test in development first

Confidence: <70% - Low
→ Educated guess, limited data
→ Requires thorough investigation
```

### Parallel Processing Indicators
Look for these markers in the output:
```markdown
[PARALLEL THREAD 1] Security Analysis - 96% confidence
[PARALLEL THREAD 2] Performance Analysis - 89% confidence
[PARALLEL THREAD 3] Code Quality - 93% confidence
[SYNTHESIS] Combined recommendations with weighted confidence
```

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Beginner (Week 1)
1. Start with `/comprehensive-review` for code analysis
2. Use `/add-backend-feature` or `/add-frontend-feature` for development
3. Try `/analyze-technical-debt` to understand code health

### Intermediate (Week 2-3)
1. Chain commands: `/do-extensive-research` → `/add-backend-feature`
2. Use specialized reviews: `/review-backend-code`, `/analyze-test-quality`
3. Fix issues with context: `/fix-backend-bug` with detailed descriptions

### Advanced (Week 4+)
1. Create custom commands: `/create-command-and-or-agent`
2. Optimize your workflow with domain-specific commands
3. Build team-specific analysis patterns

## 💬 Real User Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Platform
"We used `/add-comprehensive-feature` to build a recommendation engine. What normally takes 3 weeks took 4 days. The parallel analysis caught security issues we would have missed, and the AI-generated tests had 95% coverage out of the box."

### Example 2: Financial Services
"Running `/analyze-technical-debt` gave us an ROI calculation that justified the refactoring budget. The command paid for itself in 2 months - we reduced our bug rate by 70% and deployment time from 8 hours to 45 minutes."

### Example 3: SaaS Startup
"As a small team, `/comprehensive-review` is like having 6 senior engineers review our code simultaneously. The confidence scores help us prioritize fixes, and we get comprehensive feedback in 15 minutes instead of waiting days for reviews."
