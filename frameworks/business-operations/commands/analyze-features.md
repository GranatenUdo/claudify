# üîç Feature Analysis: $ARGUMENTS

<think harder about feature extraction, categorization, and competitive positioning>

## Quick Context
Use this command to comprehensively analyze feature sets, identify competitive advantages, and understand market positioning through systematic feature extraction and categorization.

## Execution Flow
1. **Discovery** - Extract all features from codebase/documentation
2. **Categorization** - Group features by type, value, and maturity
3. **Analysis** - Evaluate competitive positioning and differentiation
4. **Recommendations** - Identify gaps and opportunities

## Phase 1: Feature Extraction

### Comprehensive Feature Discovery

I'll begin by extracting all features from your codebase and documentation.

@TodoWrite(todos=[{"content": "Extract features from codebase", "status": "in_progress", "priority": "high", "id": "feat-1"}, {"content": "Categorize features by type", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "feat-2"}, {"content": "Analyze competitive positioning", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "feat-3"}, {"content": "Generate feature matrix", "status": "pending", "priority": "high", "id": "feat-4"}])

#### Codebase Feature Extraction

```bash
# Search for feature-related patterns
@Grep(pattern="Feature|feature|FEATURE", path=".", output_mode="files_with_matches", head_limit=20)

# Look for API endpoints (features exposed)
@Grep(pattern="@(Get|Post|Put|Delete|Patch)Mapping|@Route|app\.(get|post|put|delete)", path=".", output_mode="files_with_matches", head_limit=20)

# Find service methods (business features)
@Grep(pattern="public.*async.*Task|def.*async|func.*\(|export.*function", path=".", output_mode="files_with_matches", head_limit=20)
```

#### Documentation Analysis

```bash
# Check for feature documentation
@Glob(pattern="**/FEATURES.md", path=".")
@Glob(pattern="**/README.md", path=".")
@Glob(pattern="**/*feature*.md", path=".")
```
