# üß† Meta-Generator & Intelligent Component Creation

## Overview

The Meta-Generator is an advanced system that intelligently creates Claude Code commands, agents, hooks, and tools optimized for Opus 4. It analyzes user intent, researches best practices, and generates components that leverage Opus 4's extended reasoning capabilities.

## Key Features

### üéØ Intelligent Intent Analysis
- Analyzes user requests across multiple dimensions (technical, business, process)
- Determines optimal component mix (command only, command + agents, full suite)
- Classifies complexity and interaction models

### ü§ñ Multi-Agent Collaboration
- Leverages specialized agents for comprehensive analysis
- Tech Lead for architecture decisions
- Security Reviewer for compliance and safety
- Researcher for best practices and patterns
- Code Reviewer for quality assurance

### ‚ö° Opus 4 Optimizations
- Extended thinking (`<think harder>`) at critical decision points
- Interleaved reasoning for step-by-step analysis
- Multi-agent synthesis for complex decisions
- Maximum thinking tokens (65536) for deep reasoning

## Usage

### Via Command Line

The easiest way to use the meta-generator is through the `/create-command-and-or-agent` command:

```bash
/create-command-and-or-agent "analyze database performance bottlenecks"
```

This will:
1. Analyze your request
2. Research existing patterns
3. Design optimal architecture
4. Generate all necessary components
5. Update template generators

### Via PowerShell (Direct Usage)

```powershell
# Import the meta-generator
. .\templates\generators\meta-generator.ps1

# Create a new intelligent component
New-IntelligentComponent `
    -Name "performance-analyzer" `
    -Description "Analyze and optimize database query performance" `
    -OutputDirectory ".\.claude\commands"
```

### Via Template System

When running the template setup, the meta-generator automatically:
1. Detects when complex commands are needed
2. Generates the `/create-command-and-or-agent` command
3. Makes it available for creating future components

- Code analyzer tools
- Migration validation hooks
- Modernization roadmap generator

## Intent Classification

The meta-generator classifies requests into:

### Domains
- **Technical**: Backend, frontend, infrastructure, security, performance
- **Business**: Compliance, analytics, operations, strategy
- **Process**: Automation, validation, monitoring, documentation

### Complexity Levels
- **Simple**: Single-purpose utility command
- **Moderate**: Command with supporting hooks
- **Complex**: Multi-agent collaboration required
- **Meta**: Custom agent with specialized tools

### Interaction Models
- **One-shot**: Execute and complete
- **Interactive**: Multi-phase with user decisions
- **Continuous**: Monitoring or ongoing analysis
- **Generative**: Creates other artifacts

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
```bash
# ‚ùå Too vague
/create-command-and-or-agent "fix bugs"

# ‚úÖ Specific and actionable
/create-command-and-or-agent "diagnose and fix React component rendering performance issues"
```

### 2. Include Context
```bash
# ‚ùå Missing context
/create-command-and-or-agent "analyze code"

# ‚úÖ Context-rich
/create-command-and-or-agent "analyze Angular 19 signal usage patterns for optimization opportunities"
```

### 3. Specify Constraints
```bash
# ‚ùå No constraints
/create-command-and-or-agent "security check"

# ‚úÖ Clear constraints
/create-command-and-or-agent "OWASP Top 10 security audit for .NET Core APIs with Auth0"
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Agent Personas
The meta-generator creates agents with:
- 15+ years of specialized experience
- Domain-specific expertise
- Philosophical approaches
- Communication styles
- Decision-making patterns

### Intelligent Tool Selection
Automatically determines optimal toolsets:
- Read/Write/Edit for code manipulation
- Task for multi-agent orchestration
- WebSearch/WebFetch for research
- Bash for system operations
- TodoWrite for complex workflows

### Self-Improving Components
Generated components include:
- Usage analytics tracking
- Error pattern learning
- Performance metrics
