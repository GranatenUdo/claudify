**What It Does**:
1. **Detects Project Structure**:
   - Angular projects (angular.json)
   - .NET APIs (Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web)
   - Test projects (Microsoft.NET.Sdk with "Test")
   - Handles duplicate names intelligently

2. **Applies Templates**:
   - `{{WebProject}}` ‚Üí `MyCompany.Product.Web`
   - `{{ApiProject}}` ‚Üí `MyCompany.Product.Api`
   - `{{ArchitectureTestProject}}` ‚Üí `MyCompany.Product.ArchitectureTests`

3. **Installs Pre-Built Components**:
   - 32 commands (`.claude/commands/*.md`)
   - 17 agents (`.claude/agents/*.md`)
   - 5 hooks (PowerShell scripts)
   - 5 templates (documentation generators)

4. **Zero-Code Setup**:
   ```powershell
   .\setup.ps1 -TargetRepository "C:\path\to\your\repo"
   ```

**Architecture**:
- Cross-platform PowerShell setup
- Markdown files for commands and agents (YAML frontmatter)
- Works with Claude Code's NATIVE `.claude` directory structure
- Convention-based configuration

**Example Command** (`add-backend-feature.md`):
```markdown
---
description: Create backend API with parallel implementation
allowed-tools: [Task, Read, Write, Edit, Bash]
model: opus
---

# üöÄ Backend Feature: $ARGUMENTS

@Task(
  description="Implementation",
  prompt="Implement backend for '$ARGUMENTS':
  CREATE:
  1. Entity with factory method, IOrganizationScoped
  2. Repository interface + EF Core implementation
  3. Service with Result<T> pattern
  4. REST controller with [Authorize]
  ...",
  subagent_type="tech-lead-engineer"
)
```

- Docker images are pre-built, people don't always use Dockerfiles
- npm packages are pre-built, people don't rewrite from scratch

**Lesson**: Convenience is valuable. Don't apologize for being easy to use.

### 2. Domain Expertise Is Valuable

SDK is general-purpose. Claudify knows .NET/Angular:
- OrganizationId multi-tenant patterns
- Result<T> error handling
- Signal-based state management
- C# 13 conventions
- Angular 19 patterns

**Lesson**: Domain knowledge is defensible value. Double down on it.

### 3. Both/And Thinking

It's not Claudify OR SDK. It's Claudify AND SDK:
- Use Claudify for quick start
- Use SDK for customization
- Use both for best results

**Lesson**: Complement, don't compete.

### 4. Native Integration Is Future-Proof

Claudify uses Claude Code's native `.claude` directory structure:
- Future-proof architecture
- No custom infrastructure to maintain
- Works with ALL Claude Code features
- SDK and markdown coexist naturally

**Lesson**: Building on platform standards reduces risk.
